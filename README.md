# Abstractive Semantic Search by OpenAI  

Semantic search seeks to improve search accuracy by understanding the content of the search query. In contrast to traditional search engines, which only find documents based on lexical matches, semantic search can also find synonyms. Semantic search with OpenAI embeddings to generate numerical representations (embeddings) for text. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the input, enabling a more nuanced understanding of language. When a user submits a search query, the model converts it into an embedding, and these embeddings are then compared to those of documents in a search index. The search results are ranked based on similarity scores, providing more accurate and context-aware retrieval of information compared to traditional keyword-based search. This approach leverages advanced language models to enhance the precision of search by focusing on the underlying meaning of the text. In this notebook, we explore the process of querying a question within a book and identifying the most relevant answers to that question.
